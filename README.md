The goal of this work is to employ the dataset to develop a machine learning model that can classify high-risk fetuses (both suspicious and pathological) as accurately as highly trained medical professionals.

The data set contains information on 21 parameters obtained by performing a study called fetal tococardiogram (CTG) in pregnant women during labor. 

This study is inexpensive and allows detecting possible risks in the fetus at the time of labor, therefore being able to interpret the results of the same helps in making decisions at the time of delivery.

The data came from 2126 pregnant women who were in the third trimester of pregnancy.

The CTGs of the pregnant women were classified by three experts specialized in obstetrics, establishing which were considered as 1- normal, 2- suspicious and 3- pathological.
